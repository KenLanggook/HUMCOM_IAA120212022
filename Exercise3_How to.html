    <h2>The Military Method</h2>
    <h3>The military method is a technique that focuses on muscle relaxation, breathing, and mental visualization. Here’s how to fall asleep fast with the military method. </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sit or lay down on your bed, slowly relaxing the muscles in your body.</li>
        <li>Beginning with your face, tense your muscles then allow them to loosen naturally. Begin to take deep, calming breaths.</li>
        <li>Repeat this process until your entire body feels completely at ease.</li>
        <li>Push all thoughts from your head for 10 seconds. When your brain feels clear, picture one of the following scenarios:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Peacefully lying in a canoe on a calm lake</li>
            <li>Gently rocking back and forth in a completely dark room</li>
        </ul>
        <li>If the above is unsuccessful, mentally repeat “don’t think, don’t think, don’t think” for at least 10 seconds, and try again.</li>
    </ul>
